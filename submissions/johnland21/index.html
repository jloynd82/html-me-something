        <h1>Top 5 Beer Spots in St. Louis</h1>
        <p>
            Compiled below are the top 5 spots to drink a beer in all of St. Louis.
            Some important notes: This list does not include microbreweries or
            macrobreweries (that's a whole 'nother list). Instead, these are the
            best places to relax at the end of a long day and have a cold one.
            Based solely on the author's opinion (which also happens to be right).
            In no particular order...

            <h2>Saint Louis Hop Shop</h2>
            <p>
                Ok, so technically, TECHNICALLY, this isn't a bar at all. It's a
                storefront. But you'd never know it from meeting the owners. Home
                to some of the greatest beer enthusiasts in the city, the owners
                and managers have no problem with you cracking open your purchase
                in the store and partaking. They also have a few taps with ever-
                changing options, just to keep things interesting. Support Cherokee
                Street!
            </p>

            <h2>Fox and Hounds</h2>
            <p>
                This cozy, boozy hideaway - located in the lobby of the historic
                Cheshire Inn - is the perfect place to keep warm in the harsh winter
                months of St. Louis. Featuring comfy seating, a crackling fire, and
                enough taxidermy to keep things interesting, Fox and Hounds makes
                having a beer feel like an escape from the outside world. Highly
                recommended for a frigid night in February.

            <h2>Dressel's Pub</h2>
            <p>
                This mainstay of the Central West End (hereafter the CWE - I will not
                spell it out again) is about as charming as it gets. Warm lighting,
                great service, and walls covered in STL history and culture (and not
                just old white men!) are the trademarks of this truly authentic pub.
                Perfect for a nightcap or for a stop on a full-fledged CWE crawl,
                Dressel's is always a great place for a drink (or seven). McGurk's,
                take notes: This is what a pub actually looks like.

            <h2>Venice Cafe</h2>
            <p>
                High up on my list of "Weirdest Places I've Ever Drank," Venice Cafe
                is about as eclectic as it gets. Funky decor, an incredible patio
                covered in mosaic tile, a terrarium, and a beached boat that serves
                as a bar - this is the tip of the iceberg that is Venice. Come for
                the cheap beers, stay to marvel at the sheer amount of junk affixed
                to EVERY SINGLE SURFACE. Just remember to bring cash - the credit
                card reader (perhaps buried in troll dolls?) is a no-go.

            <h2>International Tap House</h2>
            <p>
                I won't say this is the winner, but both locations of ITap have
                just about everything you could want: One has great cozy furniture
                tucked away in nooks, the other, an amazing patio. Both have one
                thing in common, though - the largest beer selection in the city.
                No joke, this place is literally bursting at the seams with beer.
                Add to the mix knowledgeable bartenders who can find the perfect
                beer for you with even the vaguest of descriptions, and you've got
                more than a bar; you've got an experience. Keep an eye out for the
                rare and elusive Hitachino ales - normally going for
                &yen;1000 a bottle in Japan, I recommend snatching them up when you can.
