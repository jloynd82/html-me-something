            <h2>Moonlight Ramble in Saint Louis</h2>
            <p class="text">Moonlight Ramble occurs every year in Saint Louis,MO. It is a casual ride through Saint Louis
            during the night. It is not a race so everyone is usually chill. The organizers of the event have
            the streets, that are in the route, blocked off from traffic. There are some <a href="http://moonlightramble.com/rules/">regulations</a>
            to be followed during the ride but those are for your safety. It is a lot of fun seeing Saint Louis
            in the middle of night without traffic.</p>

            <h2>Haunted House Tour: All of October</h2>
            <p class="text">I haven't been to a haunted house in years and I love to get freaked out. The last one I went to
            was in Fenton where I ran full charge into a wall(bloody nose, eye) and my friend lost control of her bladder. What a blast.
            This time I want to go all out and hit a variety of them throughout the month of October. I have heard there are <a href="
            http://www.stlouisescape.com">escape rooms</a> like in the movie SAW. This I must do!</p>

            <h2>Katy Trail: Missouri</h2>
            <p class="text">Katy Trail is a Missouri State Park that follows the trail to Kansas. More specifically, the trail follows
            the old Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad. I want to complete a solo bike ride, at least from Saint Charles to Sedalia.
            Many people go on organized <a href="http://www.bikekatytrail.com">tours</a> but I would rather lone-wolf it and
            develop my own plan. There are plenty of sites to help you plan and set accommodations. First I need to set some targets
            for cycling(getting in better shape), gearing, and cash flow. </p>

            <h2>Skydive</h2>
            <p class="text">Skydiving has been on a list for the last three years. I have to commit. I am setting a goal for Spring 2017.This would
            be a major achievement for me. Just thinking about it gets me amped.</p>

            <h2>Complete LaunchCode</h2>
            <p class="text">I am still on the same high I got when I found out I was accepted into the
            program this summer. What an experience! This is not just an educational program. LaunchCode has a holistic approach
            encompassing curriculum, instruction, materials, support, environment, resources and energy. LaunchCode is much more
            than I initially thought it was. This urges me to work harder and enjoy the process.

            <h2>San Diego, CA</h2>
            <p class="text">Taking a short trip to San Diego, CA is a must. I had residence there from 2006-2008. The environment is incredible
            from the people to the weather. San Diego is expensive so I worked and enjoyed the beaches. I saw a lot of the nightlife
            and attempted surfing(water is much like concrete) but San Diego and neighboring areas have so much more to
            <a href="http://www.sandiego.com/attractions">offer</a>.
