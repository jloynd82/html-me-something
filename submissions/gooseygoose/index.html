					<h2>Part 1</h2>
					<p>Our first screenshot here is the Throne of Flame, from where the Firelord Ragnaros "chills" in his spare time.
					Not sure if I could hang here though, seems like it would be a bit uncomfortable with all that heat.</p>

					<h2>Part 2</h2>
					<p>Here we have a nice screenshot from the region of Nagrand, where historically the Orcs originate from. You'd think
					in such a calm looking place the Orcs would be nice people, but every one of them I see has a nasty snarl. Must be something in the water. </p>

					<h2>Part 3</h2>
					<p>With mushrooms as tall as trees in most places, we can be sure we are in the swamps of the Zangarmarsh. Lots
					of pretty colors among the vegitation and creatures in this region, and the sporegarr are a pleasant folk as well.
					I think they eat too many mushrooms though, theyre always quite gassy folks.</p>

					<h2>Part 4</h2>
					<p>A nice screencapture here from Shadowmoon Valley at night. Rumor has it that moon is made from Garadar Sharp, a cheese
					made right here in Draenor! We'll probably never find out, but its fun to imagine yeah?</p>

				<section>
					<a name="Part5"></a>
					<h2>Part 5</h2>
					<p>This screenshot comes from the Valley of the Four Winds. I guess that means one wind for every
						direction it could come from. Nothing like waking up and taking a deep breath
					of morning air while seeing your rice fields through the mist.</p>
					<figure>

					<h2>Part 6</h2>
					<p>Deep in the forests of Felwood we can find this scene. These three ents look like they were having quite
					the animated discussion before they were frozen in time. Perhaps it was about why the water is green here. </p>

				<section>
					<a name="Part7"></a>
					<h2>Part 7</h2>
					<p>My final screenshot is one from deep undergroud in the Stonecore. Lots of neat crystal and rock
					formations here, but dangerous if you want to explore. I'm somewhat claustrophobic, so I left soon after
				I snapped this pic. </p>
