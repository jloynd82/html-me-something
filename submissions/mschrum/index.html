                    <p>My mom and I went on an excursion to see the Ancient Myan ruins of Chichen Itza. On the way we stopped at an undergorund Cenote to go swimming. The ruins were magnificent. Most notable was the pyramid El Castilo and the observatory El Caracole. Then we stopped at the village of Valladolid to visit a historic mission church.</p>
