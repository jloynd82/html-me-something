		<h1>Painting a Collage</h1>
		<P>As a student of Fine Art at Stockton University, I had an interesting assignment: to make a collage based on a poem, and interpret that collage in the form of an oil painting. As an artist, the resulting artwork is one of my proudest moments. Please enjoy!

		<h2><cite>"Euclid Alone has Looked on Beauty Bare."</cite></h2>
		<h3>by Edna St. Vincent Millay</h3>
		<p>
			Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.<br>
			Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,<br>
			And lay them prone upon the earth and cease<br>
			To ponder on themselves, the while they stare<br>
			At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere<br>
			In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese<br>
			Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release<br>
			from dusty bondage into luminous air.<br>
			O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,<br>
			When first the shaft into his vision shone<br>
			Of light anatomized! Euclid alone<br>
			Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they<br>
			Who, though once only and then but far away,<br>
			Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.<br>
