					<h2>Kud</h2>
					<p>Two years ago, Kud followed my boyfriend into his apartment. We thought he was a girl because he didn't have balls. It turns out he was part of a catch and release program, and since he wasn't chipped, we kept him. He proceeded to infest the apartment with fleas and knock over anything around the house with liquid in it. Nowadays, he <span class="standout1">stomps</span> on my head and <span class="standout2">meows</span> while I'm sleeping because he wants to go outside where he <span class="standout3">chirps</span> at birds he don't know how to hunt. <span class="standout4">And I love him</span>. <span class="standout1">&lt3</span> <span class="standout2">&lt3</span> <span class="standout3">&lt3</span></p>

					<h2>Flicka</h2>
					<p>Flicka was brought to me by a coworker as a little baby kitten with her brother, <a href="#pojke">Pojke</a>. She talks <span class="standout1">all</span> <span class="standout2">day</span> <span class="standout3">long</span>, and we have conversations on the toilet. She licks my fingers then bonks them with her head. She doesn't like to be picked up. If you pick her up, she screams like she's dying, and all the other cats come to watch. <span class="standout4">And I love her</span>.<span class="standout1">&lt3</span> <span class="standout2">&lt3</span> <span class="standout3">&lt3</span></p>

					<h2>Pojke</h2>
					<p>Pojke is <a href="#flicka">Flicka</a>'s brother. He wants to be a big ol fatty. He <span class="standout1">eats</span> and <span class="standout2">eats</span> and <span class="standout3">eats</span> all the other cats' food, and then rolls over for you to rub his belly. When I come home he waits at the tops of the stairs lookin at me like a little gremlin. <span class="standout4">And I love him</span>.<span class="standout1">&lt3</span> <span class="standout2">&lt3</span> <span class="standout3">&lt3</span></p>

						<h4>Samosa (and Spaulding)</h4>
						<p>Samosa was my cross-eyed cat. My ex and I got him and his sister, Spaulding, from <a href="http://www.tenthlifecats.org">Tenth Life</a> to scare away the big rat and little mice who lived in our first St, Louis residence several years ago. Upon adoption, the ex and I agreed that if we ever broke up, I would get Samosa, and he would get Spaulding. One day Samosa never came home. My ex and I broke up shortly thereafter. Maybe I'm superstitious, but beautiful baby must've sacrificed himself so I could break the curse of that shitty relationship. <span class="standout4">And I miss them</span>.<span class="standout1">&lt3</span> <span class="standout2">&lt3</span> <span class="standout3">&lt3</span></p>
