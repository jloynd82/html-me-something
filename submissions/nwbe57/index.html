            <h1>My Concert History</h1>

            <p>I am an avid fan of all things guitar, and also of many styles
                of music in general.  Over the years I have been to many
                great concerts.  Some of them in giant amphitheaters/arenas and others
                in smaller venues.  Whether the artist had amazing virtuosity, or just
                some unique sound that no one else comes close to, these shows all left
                me wanting more.  Here are some of the great artists I have seen
                in my life.

                <br>
                <p>BB King and Buddy Guy influenced almost every guitar player that came after them.  BB died last year at almost 90 years old, and the music
                    world was quick to voice their appreciation for his contributions to the history of guitar playing and music in general.  Buddy Guy just
                    celebrated his 80th birthday and still has more energy than most people 50 years his junior.  He is the last living Mississippi blues
                    legend, and he is still one of the best guitar players around.  He was kind of like Jimi Hendrix, 10 years before Hendrix.  I am
                    privileged to have seen both of them 3 times.

            <h2>60's Legends</h2>

                <img src="images/becks.jpe" alt="Jeff Beck">
                <img src="images/carlos.jpe" alt="Carlos Santana">
                <br><br><br>

                <p>Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Carlos Santana all grew up idolizing BB King and Buddy Guy.  They all got to play with Jimi Hendrix.
                    Jimi Hendrix considered Eric Clapton his favorite guitarist.  Eddie Van Halen said Clapton was his biggest influence.  The Gibson Les
                    Paul guitar was discontinued and out of production until Clapton started playing one in the mid-sixties.  It has since become one of
                    the most iconic guitars of the last fifty years.  The Eric Clapton concert I attended in 2001 was the best show I ever saw.  His
                    playing was fluid and wonderful on every song.  His whole band was made up of seasoned masters and they were on fire the whole night.
                </p>
                <p>Carlos Santana became huge after blowing away the crowd at Woodstock 69'.  Santana's first three albums went number one and he has
                    continued to be a groundbreaking player ever since.  Everything about his playing is completely unique to him.  He sounds like
                    nobody else.  His band is bigger than most rock bands, has a lot of percussion, and produces a groove like no other band I have
                    ever seen.  I have never seen more people who obviously aren't dancers getting down like they have no control over themselves than
                    I saw at that Santana show.
                </p>
                <p>Jeff Beck is probably the most unique guitar player alive.  He uses the volume knob, tone knobs, and whammy bar on his guitar
                    all at once to make it sound like a host of other instruments.  He plays instrumentals that are everything from the hardest
                    rock to classical, jazz, blues, fusion, rockabilly, funk, r&b, electronic, modern and any other style you can name.  I saw him play
                    shortly after BB King died, and he played a version of "The Thrill is Gone" that only he could have played as tribute to his idol.
                    Watching him do his thing was definitely among the most impressive displays of talent I have ever seen.

            <h2>Acoustic Shows</h2>

                <img src="images/tim.jpe" alt="Tim Reynolds">

                <br><br><br>

                <p>Dave Matthews became hugely famous during my formative years.  For a few years in the 90's, his music was all over
                    TV and radio.  I saw The Dave Matthews Band in an outdoor amphitheatre while I was in college.  The original lineup
                    of his band was still intact, and they were phenomenal.  Dave is not a virtuosic player who can dazzle you with technical
                    prowess, but he is a very good rhythmic/melodic player with his own chord fingerings that make his playing unique.  I was
                    pleasantly surprised at how good him and his band were.
                </p>
                <p>Tim Reynolds is best known for his performances with Dave Matthews.  He is an absolute master of the instrument.  He can
                    fingerpick like a flamenco player, or play with a pick with great speed and precision.  His fingers
                    are incredibly strong and he bends the strings like they are as flimsy as rubberbands.  I saw him play alone in a theater
                    with a looper.  A looper is a machine that records a short bit of music, and then plays it over and over again.  It allows
                    the player to record multiple lines of music and layer them together to sound like many players are playing at the same time.
                    I had no idea what to expect seeing him alone without Dave Matthews.  I was in awe of his abilities and the great music he
                        produced that night.
                </p>
                <p>Leo Kottke is one of the great legends in the history of the guitar.  He has the unique ability to play two separate musical
                    lines at the same time on a guitar.  This is much harder to do on a guitar as opposed to a piano, because you are only pushing
                    the notes down with one hand.  In addition to this ability, he also has an encyclopedic knowledge of chords and uses different
                    string tunings on almost every song.  He can play with a slide as good as anyone, and also incorporates a lot of string
                    bending into his unique musical phrasing.  I saw Leo in a small club venue, and I couldn't take my eyes off of his hands doing
                    their thing that night.

            <h2>Local Favorites</h2>

                <br><br>

                <p>The Urge are probably the most popular band from St. Louis.  I have seen the Urge 7 or 8 times, and every time the
                    local crowd is just as pumped to see them as they were in the 90's when they initially became famous.  Their album
                    "Receiving the Gift of Flavor" was one of those albums that is great from the first track to the last.  They usually
                    play almost every song from that album, and the crowd sings every word.
                </p>
                <p>Lately I have gotten to really like a
                local "Grateful Dead" cover band called "The 710 Band".  They are middle aged guys who have been playing together
                for over 30 years, and they play bars around town.  The vocals, rhythm playing, and solos are always great. They play
                 "Grateful Dead" songs with a more thumping, pulsating groove than most Dead bands, and I actually prefer their
                 versions of some of the songs to the Dead's.  They have a pretty regular following, and when they play "Sugaree"
                 or "Shakedown Street", the crowd really gets into it.  The also throw in some Bob Dylan and Credence Clearwater
                 Revival songs, but play them in the same wonderful groove as the Dead songs.  Do yourself a favor and check them
                 out, even if you're not familiar with the Dead.
                </p>
