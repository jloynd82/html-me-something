					<h3 id = italicize>I've been playing video games for decades! From the Atari 2600 all the way up to PlayStation 4</h3>
					<p>The first game I ever played was the one and only Pac-Man.  It started a lifelong hobby that I enjoy now more than ever!</p>

					<h2 id = category>Movies</h2>
					<h3 id = italicize>Who doesn't love movies?! In my opinion the 80's and 90's had some of the best movies ever made.</h3>
					<p>Every Friday night is movie night at my house.  October, however, is when it's time to watch all the classic horror movies! Halloween, Friday the 13th,
						and Poltergiest just to name a few.</p>

					<h2 id = category>Bicycles</h2>
					<h3 id = italicize>Because you gotta get some exercise in sometime...</h3>
					<p>Most of us do a lot of bike riding as kids, but it's just as fun as an adult! I enjoy both road and mountain biking. It's a great
					stress reliever.</p>
