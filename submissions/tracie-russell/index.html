                <p>Our first stop after checking out our lodging for the next couple of days
                    was the Guinness Brewery.  We even had a special VIP tasting in a secluded bar.</p>

                <p>A must see was the ancient manuscript called the Book of Kells.  Trinity College has
                  a beautiful display and educational exhibit on the practices of that time period.</p>

                <h2>Cork</h2>
                  <p>Cork was our second stop after heading out of the city.
                    We stayed in a very charming town oustide of Cork called Kinsale.
                    Some notable activities in the area (or visited on the way to Cork).</p>

                    <p>The mediveal town of Kilkenny was a stop on our way to Cork.  We hit up the
                        Smithwick's brewery and walked through the town to Kilkenny Castle. Next to the
                        castle was a lovely artists' market as well.</p>

                    <p>I've been told that no trip to Ireland is complete without kissing the Blarney
                          Stone.  I guess my trip wasn't complete...though, we DID visit it.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.jamesonwhiskey.com/en/visit-us">Jameson Distillery</a></h3>
                    <p>The Jameson distillery was definietly a place we had to visit. The tour was great
                      and so was the whiskey.  My whiskey knowledge was increased significantly on this trip!</p>

                <h2>Galway</h2>
                  <p>Galway, the final stop before heading to Dublin for the flight home.  We saw many things
                    on the way there, or near the city.</p>

                    <p>Bunratty Castle and Folk Park is one of the neatest Medieval recreations.  The villiage
                      is contains historically recreated buildings, people that have learned the old
                      crafts, and the restored castle.</p>

                    <p>We visited one of Grace O'Malley's castles on Clare Island.  After a boat ride out to the island, and a failed
                      attempt at riding a bike through the hills, we just enjoyed the natural island beauty.</p>
