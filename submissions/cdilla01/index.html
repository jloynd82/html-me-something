<p>We first heard about this young company on an episode of the Shark Tank. Milk and Brookies is the brain child of Jovon English, along with her partners, Naimah Harris and Tisa Smart-Washington. Milk and Brookies is a mash-up of a brownie and cookie, hence the name Brookie. They offer specialty flavors such as red velvet, blondie, peanut butter, snickerdoodle, and much more. Brookies can be ordered online and are the perfect dessert for a company christmas party or gift</p>
