                    <h2>Shibuya Square</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is probably the busiest
                        intersection in the world. It was memorable just
                        crossing the street with everyone else.

                    <h2>Street Food</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had a lot of street food in Japan,
                        and the Takoyaki stands were some of my favorites.
                        Takoyaki is basically just octopus and veggies, sauce
                        and deep-fried batter.

                    <h2>Hachiko Statue</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hachiko was a dog remembered in
                        Japan for his loyalty. Hachiko would meet his owner on his
                        way home from work everyday at Shibuya station, and
                        after his owner died Hachiko continued to show up at
                        the same time each day for the next ten years. His statue
                        is a popular meeting spot in Tokyo.

                    <h2>Tonkatsu at Maisen Omotesando</h2>
                    <p>
                        I basically ate most of the time in
                        Tokyo. There's literally over 100,000 restaurants in
                        Tokyo. Everything I had was really good.

                    <p>
                        Got a chance to go up part of
                        Mt. Fuji.

                    <h2>Shinto Wedding</h2>
                    <p>
                        Came across a traditional
                        Shinto wedding as I was walking through Meiji Park.
