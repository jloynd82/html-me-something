                    </div>
                    <p>Speech and debate, for me, is an extracurricular activity that my school (and many others) provide.  Speech refers to non-debate events such as Dramatic and Humorous Interpretation, Prose and Poetry reading, Extemporaneous Speaking, Congress, and many others.  Debate, on the other hand, involves a pair of teams arguing about a given topic.  Which you choose to do (or if you choose to do both) pretty much just depends on personal preference, and personal interests.</p>

                        <h2>How did I get started?</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>I got started last year.  I was in a Public Speaking class at my high school, and ironically wasn't very spoken out in it.  One of our earliest assignments was to do a 3-to-5-minute prose reading in front of the class.  For this, I opted on an Edgar Allan Poe piece - specifically, The Tell-Tale Heart.  I later learned that as far as speech and debate goes, that's a piece that's extremely overdone - but regardless, I went in and performed it, and discovered pretty quickly that it was actually something I was good at.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="sectionhead">
                        <h1>Contention 3</h1>
                        <h2>"Furthermore..."</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Before long, I joined the actual Speech and Debate club at the school.  At my first competition, I performed the same piece, still as a prose reading piece.  However, in following competitions I performed it instead as a Dramatic Interpretation (which is slightly longer, and allows for more movement of your body, but also needs to be completely memorized), while choosing an additional piece to do as a Prose piece.  I went on like this for several competitions, placing relatively well most of the time.  And later on, I also began doing the Debate side of things with a partner.  In the end, Speech and Debate was an extremely rewarding activity for me, and I'm happy I did it.</p>
