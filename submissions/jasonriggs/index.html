                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I am a technophile (aka &ldquo;ideapokeian&rdquo;); an avid learner; and an aspiring Marketing Technologist, with a natural curiosity, high learning velocity and strong work ethic.   As a natural problem solver who values teamwork, fun, and creativity, I love the start-up culture.  I am an &ldquo;all-in&rdquo; kind of guy who loves to bounce around ideas and be involved in decision making in a creative and innovative atmosphere.  I love to solve problems and am currently enrolled in LaunchCode's Summer of Code program.</p>
