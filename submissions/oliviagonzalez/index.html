                    <p>Once upon a time, a woman by the name of OG wanted to walk outside of her neighborhood. She had heard of many wonderous far off lands, but they were all quite far. One friend had told her to walk in a place called California, but the journey there would require crossing mountains and deserts. Another friend told her to explore an even larger place called Europe, but that required crossing the sea. OG decided to save those for another day. OG was sure that the mystical lands of Missouri must have beautiful sites to offer. Thus began her adventure, her quest to hike in Missouri's finest of parks.</p>

                    <h4 class="center">Chapter 1: Cuivre River State Park</h4>
                    <p>OG began her quest in <a href="https://mostateparks.com/park/cuivre-river-state-park">Cuivre River State Park</a> where she learned the importance of good company, bug spray, and delicious sandwiches. An assortment of flying insects greeted her with enthusiasm that day, propelling her forward through the tall grass towards a beach. <i>A beach in missouri! Surely you are joking my dear!</i> It was no joke. No mirage from the afternoon sun. No hallucination brought on by the insect parties that OG partook in. There was indeed a small sandy lake "beach" that many a young child was delighting in. OG was in awe at this concept for she had long missed the waters of the gulf coast where she grew up. It's salty water kissing sandy beaches called to her on hot summer days long after she had moved inland. So, OG ate a sandwich by the beach growing accustomed to the idea of lakes as such.</p>

                    <p>After her lunch, OG continued on through the trees until a shout stopped her where she stood. "Look! I've almost got it!" A man called out. With fishing rod in hand, he nodded toward the murky waters in a small offshoot of the lake. A splash captured OG's attention. For a moment she was sure that some muddy lake creature was about to shoot from the depths, and she was right. The muddy lake creature was the largest fish she'd ever seen. OG watched the man grapple with his fishing rod before continuing on through the insect parties. All in all it was a grand adventure. She would certainly be back.</p>

                    <h4 class="center">Chapter 2: Castlewood State Park</h4>
                    <p>On the day of OG's next adventure a terrible terrible occured. She slept in. Gone was the dream of exploring somewhere far away, but within a day. She scrambled through maps to find a new place, and found just that in <a href="https://mostateparks.com/park/castlewood-state-park">Castlewood State Park</a>. A mere 30 minutes away, it was the perfect spot to explore. OG laced up her boots, packed her lunch and headed out to see the magic of this Castlewood.</p>

                    <h4 class="center">Chapter 3: St. Joe State Park</h4>
                    <p>Fall was in full force. The leaves were fiery in color, and covering the ground. A patch of grass was a rare sight as the trees prepared themselves for winter. It was in these conditions that OG visited <a href="https://mostateparks.com/park/st-joe-state-park">St. Joe State Park</a>, and what a visit it was. OG spent hours wandering the beautiful fall woods, watching people on horses ride by, and trying not to let the leaves lead her astray.</p>
