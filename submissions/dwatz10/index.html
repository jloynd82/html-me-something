            <h1 id="heading">My favorite Game of Thrones Spin-off Ideas</h1>
            <p class="close">Sadly it appears Game of Thrones will come to an end in just two short seasons.<br>
                This leaves an interesting universe full of imaginative lore largely unexplored.<br>
                There is hope, however, as G.R.R. Martin has expressed interest in a spin-off series.<br>
                So lets take a look at a few of the most promising concepts.</p>
        <article>
            <header>
                <h1 class="tabs">III:</h1>
                <h2>The Tales of Dunk and Egg</h2>
            </header>
            <img class="center" src="images/pic1.jpg" alt="Fail" height="450" width="350">
            <p class="down">The Tales of Dunk and Egg is an obvious choice because Martin has already written a number novellas about the pair.
                The adventures of Sir Duncan and his squire are much more light hearted than A Song of Fire and Ice which Game of Thrones is based on.
                While lacking the political intrigue of Game of Thrones these stories have plenty of action and a few direct tie ins to Game of Thrones.
                It not the most intriquing of all possible spin-offs but is certainly a contender.</p>

                <h2>Aegon's Conquest</h2>
            </header>
            <img class="center" src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="Fail" height="300" width="500">
            <p class="down">Aegon's Conquest of Westeros is often alluded to in Game of Thrones and is potentially one of the most interesting stories to be told in the Fire and Ice universe.
                A show set during Aegon's conquest would allow the exploration of Valyrian culture, which has been gone for centuries during the events of Game of Thrones.
                Such a series would also afford a look at Westeros before the seven kingdoms were united. Finaly, the life of Aegon the Conqueror was filled with momentous battles
                and could easily match the epic scale of the current series' magic, dragons, and medieval warfare.</p>

                <h2>Robert's Rebellion</h2>
            </header>
            <img class="center" src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="Fail" height="300" width="500">
            <p class="down">In the top spot is Robert's Rebellion which takes place mere decades before the events of Game of Thrones.
                This series would allow fans to see many of the characters they know such as Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon, and Barristan Selmy in their youth.
                Additionally, the series could flesh out characters and stories only mentioned in the show like Rhaegar's plot to usurp his father Arys.
                This series could easily include all the action, back stabbing, and moral ambiguity which so many have come to love in Game of Thrones making it an obvious favorite.</p>
