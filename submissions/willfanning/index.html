                            <p>
                                I attended college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and graduated with a BS in Chemistry in Dec. 2011. The concentration of my degree was in Environmental Chemistry. Life science and the study of the natural world remains an academic interest of mine.

                        <h4>Career</h4>
                            <p>
                                After graduating I began working as an Analytical Chemist at a pharmaceutical testing laboratory. My job duties included classical wet chemistry and instrumental analysis of pharmaceutical compounds. Lab work required lots of documentation, attention to detail, and precision in your actions (all good traits to carry on towards programming).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I signed up for the Summer of Code program with the intent of breaking in to the local technology sector. I hope to find interesting and challenging work in areas where science and computer software interact.

                    <h3>A Cool Trip</h3>
                        <h4>Stonewall, CO</h4>
                        <p>
                            In southern Colorado, west of Trinidad and east of the Sangre De Christo Mountain Range is a town called Stonewall, appropriately named for the large stone wall formation that slices through town and the surrounding area. I am lucky enough to visit a ranch here every two years. Most recently, I went back in June 2016. It's one of the most beautiful places I've seen and I look forward to returning.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Staying Active</li>
                            <p>
                                When I get in the mood to move around, I turn to basketball, lifting, running, cycling, and skating to burn off some energy.
                            </p>
                        <li>Staying Inactive</li>
                            <p>
                                I also like taking it easy at home. I can happily spend a day inside reading, playing piano, listening to music, watching sports, and browsing the net.

                        <li>Games</li>
                            <p>
                                I like solving puzzles and developing strategies. I can often be found doing a crossword puzzle or playing a game of chess on my phone. I have a collection of board games with all kinds of fun game-mechanics and possible strategies. Some of my favorite strategy games include Carcassonne, Tikal, and Eclipse. I enjoy word games like Boggle, Scrabble, and Bananagrams too.
