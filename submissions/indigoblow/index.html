            <p>It's not that I watch The Lion King often. In fact, I find myself
                listening to the soundtrack moreso, but I'll always have a soft
                spot in my heart for this film. I remember, at 12 years old, taking
                the new Metrolink to Union Station 10 Cine' with my little sister
                to see it. From that moment on I consumed everything related to
                this movie, from saving magazine covers and articles to owning
                sheets, watches, clothes and housewares Lion King related. Little
                did I know another another film opened that month that would change
                my viewing habits forever, but in that's for later. The Lion King
                will always be one ofmy favorites.</p>

            <p>I was pretty young when I saw Raise the Red Lantern for the first
            time. In fact, I remember watching it with my mom on Starz or Encore on
            a lazy afternoon. It was my earliest exposure to a foreign culture and
            sparked an interest in Chinese history, but more importantly, exposed me
            subtitles which opens up a wide swath of films. Raise the Red Lantern
            was an early film of both director, Zhang Yimou (House of Flying
            Daggers, Hero) and actress, Gong Li (Farewell My Concubine, 2046).

            <p>If there is one film that exhibits a shift in my movie viewing habits,
            it is Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was released on 14 October 1994. I remember
            nothing about its advertising campaign or that it was a critical darling.
            I watched Quentin win his Best Original Screenplay Academy Award with no
            excitement of feelings, but when I saw Pulp Fiction on HBO the following
            summer everything changed. I'd never experienced anything like the high style,
            nonlinear storyline and dialouge in this film. It raised the bar.</p>

            <p>Most of us watch old movies on television, but if you ever get <thead>
                chance to see one on the big screen you should take the oppurtunity.
                On the Waterfront is not flashy, but is made for the big screen which
                magnifies the impact of Marlon Brando's performance. This performance
                changed acting forever and once you've seen it, will change your
                definition of "good acting" forever.

                <p>Starship Troopers is a pure "cult favorite". I'm not sure if it's even
                good, but I love it. For me, it's the kind of movie I watch
                whenever it comes on. It looks like a Syfy original movie and based so
                loosely on the book of the same name, producers had the license the title.
                Director Paul Verhoeven said the film was made to satirize facism.
                If he says so.
