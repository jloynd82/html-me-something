<!-- General Information/Introduction -->
		<h3 class="subject"> A Summary </h3>
			<p>As I sit here and consider where I want this first assignment to go, I've come to a very reflective place. The past month has been one of transitions, so it seems only appropriate that I consider how my path is currently being shaped by my last two years of experience as an AmeriCorps service member in St. Louis. I've accomplished more than I can even describe -- both personally and professionally -- during my time volunteering, but I don't want to pretend that the choice to move or to self-motivate to continue service was an easy one. I worked long hours and was exhausted; I was sometimes beaten down; and, at the same time, not one ounce of me regrets any of the choices that I've made during it all, even if it did require me to completely revamp everything. </p><br><br><br>

			<p> My time in STL as an AmeriCorps volunteer was undoubtedly representative of this list. So, now that the term is over, I find need to put down a few thoughts about my service. I found so much fulfillment in new experience but also grieved my old self, put away. These two years truly brought me to a space where I felt the drive to force change where federal, state, institutional, and organizational red tape inhibits and denounces self-advocacy. It's hard for me to move on from everything I've helped build. But, there's always next, which I'm calling now. <br><br><br>
