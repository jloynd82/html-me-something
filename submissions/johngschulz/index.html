                    <p>Hi, my name is John Schulz and I'm going tell ya'll a
                        little about myself. I was born in the beautiful city of
                        St. Louis, Missouri - and I've lived here just about
                        ever since. I'm 27 years young, and about just as wise
                        some would say.Here's how it all started:</p>

                <article id="begin">
                    <h2>In the beginning</h2>
                    <img src="images/baby.jpg">
                    <div class="subtext">The young John baring it all</div>
                    <p>I born at St. Mary's Hospital, December 12th, 1988. I
                        remember that cold morning, just like it was yesterday..
                        .. Anywho, I grew up in a house with an older brother
                        and sister, (Justin, and Jessica respectively) in
                        University City.  Played soccer, went to school, and
                        learned the ropes the hard way(being the youngest
                        and all).</p>
                </article>
                <article id="middle">
                    <h2>In the middle</h2>
                    <img src="images/golf.jpg">
                    <div class="subtext">Hanging with the old golf team</div>
                    <p>When I made it to Highschool, I focused on sleeping,
                        video-gaming, soccer &#9917; and golf&#9971;  (nothing to
                        brag about if you look at our season records). At the
                        end of it all I had enough learning to get me into
                        college.  Went to Truman State University in Northeast
                        Missouri.  Had one hell of a time, but I couldn't figure
                         out which major was right for me, and found myself back
                         in St. Louis before too long.</p>

                <article id="now">
                    <h2>In the now</h2>
                    <img src="images/now.jpg">
                    <div class="subtext">Leisure time at a friend's place</div>
                    <p>After moving back in to town from college, I found myself
                         bouncing around to different jobs here and there.  I've
                         helped rehab houses, worked at a fitness center, a
                         large company that specializes in printing healthcare
                         forms, and several restaurants. I've been working at a
                         wonderful restaurant called "The Fountain on Locust"
                         for the past 6 years and counting. I am a server/manager
                         and I really do enjoy where I work.  After persuing
                         different ways to back into school for technology,
                         my opportunity arose through Launchcode! Taking classes
                         in programming and web development over the Summer of
                         2016, I think I've really found what I want to do.</p>

                    <div class="subtext">Thinking and working hard in his Launchcode class</div>
                    <p>Launchcode has provided me with a new opportunity to
                        restart and "launch" a new career.  My goal is to take
                        the awesome skills that I've been learning and work with
                        Launchcode to find an internship to build upon my skills
                        and advance into what I hope to be a new career. I know
                        I'm going to have to put in a lot of hard work, and take
                        time out of my social life to accomplish these goals -
                        but it's time to start fulfilling my potential. to
                        infinity and beyond!!</p>
