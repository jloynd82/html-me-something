        <h3>A Fun Trip I Recently Took</h3>
            <article>
              <p>This past winter, my girlfriend April &amp I went to Vail, CO for a ski trip. I used to live there, so I know how to cut some corners and not pay full price for everyting. Vail is very expensive.
                <p>Coincidentally, April's roommate Annicka was going to Colorado to ski with her family during the exact same time as we were. So we all carpooled together. Here's a picture of April, Annicka and I in Salina, KS. On the road!</p>

                <p>Here is a picture of April &amp I on Vail's mountain.</p>

        <h3>A Passion Or Hobby of Mine</h3>
            <p id= "bikes">BICYCLES!!!!!!</p>
            <p>I like to ride bicycles. I don't ride as much as I used to, but I still do love to ride bikes.</p>
            <p>This is a picture of my fastest bike. It's a beauty.</p>
            <img src="http://cloud.bicyclebluebook.com/zoom/ral_rush_hour_black_white_12_z.jpg" />
            <p>This is another bike I own. It isn't exactly the same as the one shown below, but it is the same year and color. I've taken this bike on several bike trips across parts of Missouri via the Katy Trail.</p>
            <img src = "https://s.graphiq.com/sites/default/files/975/media/images/2012_Surly_Cross-Check_259106.jpg" />
            <p>Briefly, I was on a bicycle racing team. We raced at the Velodrome on North Kingshighway. Here's a picture someone took of me while I was admiring the fast bicycle riders.</p>
            <img src = "https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/970772_589783447708842_502064811_n.jpg?oh=2af2bd4a37b1862937a1f90e9bf0c88d&oe=5810EAB8" />

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>Here's some quotes I like. I'm just experimenting with tags at this point.</p>
              <blockquote>
                ...while there is a lower class, I am in it; and while there is a criminal element, I am of it; and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.
              <p>Eugene V. Debs</p>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
              Let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
              <p>The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
              </blockquote>
