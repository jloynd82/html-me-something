        <p>Born in February 2005, this black haired feline enjoyed life for ten years alone with her human in a comfy apartment. Then catastrophe struck: her person got married.  The large new home didn't bother her, with its many rooms to explore and lounge in, but Ludo, the large dog she discovered there, did.  Ludo bothered her often.  He chased her, tried to eat her food, and, worst of all, licked her.</p>

        <p>At approximately 18 months old, a kind-hearted man adopted Ludo from a shelter.  Ludo loved the man; the man loved Ludo. They did everything they possibly could together like running in parks, riding in the car on errands, and watching movies on the big TV. After a couple years of baching together, Ludo and the man's lives changed: the man got married.  Ludo felt happy because he loved his new lady person.  She gave him treats and let him swim in nearby ponds.  Best of all, when she moved into the house, she brought Mrs. Brown with her.  Ludo loved Mrs. Brown at once.  Not only did Mrs. Brown smell good, but she made interesting noises, often played games like hide-and-seek or tag, and had good taste in fish pat&egrave;.</p>

        <p>Ludo and Mrs. Brown's people adopted Arty Morty from a rescue shelter.  Arty, an artless "Boggle" (beagle-boxer mix) of eight months, joined the family to give companionship to Ludo, then a mature six year old dog.  Mrs. Brown, now eleven years old, lived in her own mostly private quarters.  After a failed suicide attempt during the past Thanksgiving holiday (if humans could read Meow, they would have understood her desperate pleas for help: GET RID OF THE DOG OR ELSE!!! and I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS...) Mrs. Brown only saw Ludo at random intervals, and refused him even the mildest games of chase.  Ludo needed a friend; he needed one badly.  Arty Morty happily accepted the role.  The dogs barked and rough-housed and ate snacks together; at night they teamed up against Mrs. Brown and mocked her hiss-trionics.  Ludo loved Arty.  Arty loved her new family, but she also loved her new found freedom outside the shelter's pen.  She did whatever she wanted to do, regardless of her people's commands, and she did it whenever she wanted to.  Her people contacted the shelter and learned that Arty Morty had lived with two other families previously.  She's a handful, her people said, but we love her and Ludo loves her, so we'll keep her.  Upon hearing this decision, Mrs. Brown refused to purr for a week (WE ARE NOT A-MEWS-ED).</p>
