                <h2>PART I: Volge</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_volge01.png"/>
                    In the gentle swirls of the river Epsilon, Volge floats in deep reverie.

                    Suddenly, he is rudely woken up by a dark figure towering above him - <br> "Get out," it shrieked, "you are not dead yet!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_volge03.png"/>
                    Volge finds his way back ashore, and trudges through a quiet jungle littered with lightbulbs. <br>He collects an armful of them as if they were fruits.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    Volge selects one and eats it. Ichor spills out of his mouth as he chews thoughtfully. <br>"I suppose I shall go for another swim now," he said to nobody in particular.

                <p>
                    <img src="img_ande01.png"/>
                    Ande is quite fond of Shadows: <br>He likes them so much that he drinks one for breakfast every morning and never grows tired of it.

                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    One day, the Shapes in Ande's favourite Shadow Lamp escaped. Out the window they went!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    Here we see Ande trying to catch new ones. He is exhausted.

                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    Betthe collects Shiny Things because they make her happy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    There is a quiet jungle in her backyard which she decorates to her liking.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <img src="img_placeholder.jpeg"/>
                    Occasionally she finds that her Shiny Things have been shattered and painted gold. <br>"Why, if only they weren't broken. I do really like this new colour."
