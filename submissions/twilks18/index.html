            <h2 class="short">Who Am I?</h2>
            <p class ="stayput">Hello out there. My name is TaNeisha and
        this page here is just a little bit about me. I currently work at Sunedison Semiconductor
      where I analyze wafer semiconductors for contaminants. I played tennis is in High School, although
       I don't care to watch tennis. I enjoy watching horror movies and I enjoy hanging out with my friends.</p>

            <div><h2 class="long"> What Am I Doing Now?</h2></div>
              <p class="moveright"> Although I currently work at Sunedison. I have decided to focus on a career change that will include Computer
            Science.  Right now I am enrolled in Summer of Code which is part LaunchCode. I am hoping to learn how to create apps, because
            I hope to have my own Real Estate business one day. So I would like to create an app that will be useful to my business.</p>

              <h2 class="long">What I Want For The Future</h2>
              <p class="stayput"> What I want for the future is to have a career in Computer Science. I would like to either add to the current knowledge now which is Biology. Otherwise I would like to change entirely to Computer Science.
        I would like to learn to create an app for my Real Estate business. This is the main reason that I would like to go into Computer Science.
        The app will not only be beneficial to myself it would very useful for people who are looking for homes or are trying tho sell their homes. My end goal is to
        be able to help others in need financially. There are so many people here in this country that need help just as much as those that are outside this country.</p>
