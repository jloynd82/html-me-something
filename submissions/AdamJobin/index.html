      <p>When i was 20 i was stuck at a party with a heap of drunk idiots and fights started happening so i wanted to go home. My phone died and I didn't have keys or my wallet on me so i decided to walk home across town at midnight.
I walked most of the way home when i came across a 30 year old on a push bike who was chasing another man on a scooter up the road. Little did i know that he was trying to mug the other guy.. i walked faster and kept my head down..
The guy rode around the block on his bike then when he knew i was alone he jumped off his bike and dragged me into a bush at knife point.. he tried to mug me bit when he realised i had nothing on me he decided he would rape me instead.. i convinced him that we would be busted at the side of the road and he should come home with me.. we walked for what seemed like 40 mins and he held me by the throat so i couldnt run..
We got to a hill and i offered to push his bike for him as it looked heavy.. i kept the bike between us.. we got to the top and i saw a taxi at the bottom.. i threw the bike at him and ran away screaming rape .. blisters all over my feet but i didnt care.. all you care about is escaping..
He ran away and luckily they could get enough DNA evidence to catch him .. he recently was sentanced to 12 years jail! I was very lucky!
NEVER WALK ALONE AT NIGHT!!	&reg;</p>

      <h1 class="class">Kidnapping Story 2</h1>
      <p>This happened a while ago when I was 6. I come from a third world countries and at the time, kidnappings were at an all time high. We lived in a fairly nice neighbourhood, no kidnappings there, no theft, great neighbours. We felt pretty safe and therefore, my mom wasn't too worried. Our house was a gated residence so we had a front yard and backyard. I was out one morning in the front yard, playing with some toys while my mom was inside working or cooking or whatever. Someone knocked on the front gate, me being a dumb child decided to go up and ask who it was. It was this fairly old man who asked for some water, me being the nice, helping child opened the door and was snatched immediately.
I don't particularly remember what happened after that but I woke up in a compound which i'm pretty sure was far from home. They hadn't done anything bad to me AFAIK. But they did try to feed me food that I didn't like. I was a picky child and so, all i ate was fruit. They had asked for ransom, which to this day, I don't know how much it was. They just kept me in a room all day with duct tape on my mouth and ropes around my feet and hands. They did take duct tape off to let me drink water or eat food. Anyways, a few days later, the police busted them and arrested them. They ended up in jail for life is what I was told.
Not too long after that, my parents decided to move to a different country and now all is well. I still think about what might have gone wrong if they had sold me into child slavery or something (fairly common in my country). Life resumed after that, I'm as happy as a 20 year old can be. Nothing really changed. I still don't know why I was kidnapped, maybe for ransom or whatever. In exactly a month, it'll be my 14th kidnapping anniversary!</p>

      <p>When I was six I was playing in front of my house when an older blond woman ran up to my house frantically asking me to help her find her dog. I knew not to talk to strangers, but she looked very kind and genuinely worried so I agreed to help her. It wasn't until she grabbed my arm and started dragging me farther from my house that I realized I was in danger and started screaming and crying. Luckily, three older boys from the neighborhood saw what was happening and started chasing after us. She tried picking me up, but I wriggled and bite until she dropped me, jumped in her car and took off.</p>
