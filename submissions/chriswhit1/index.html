                <article><h2>France</h2></article>
                    <p>I got accepted to a sustainable agriculture program in France.
                    I was the only one that signed up to do the program in my college and I had to take the plane by myself.
                    I was very nervous.  When I got off the plane in a new country I took a deep breath and was able to find my way to my first destination.
                    I went to many tourist sites and visited many farms.  Other students from all over the United States were also in the program. I quickly made a lot of friends
                    and will always cheerish my experiences from my France trip.
                <article><h2>Japan</h2></article>
                    <p>A few months after my France trip I was invited to go to Hiroshima, Japan with a couple of my agriculture professors.
                    Since I did so well in my classes in France I was given an opportunity to go to Japan
                    and mingle with some agriculture students.  I have never been to Japan before and had no idea what it was like.</p>

                    <p>Japan was beautiful and full of mountains. Immediately I fell in love with the food.
                    Everyone was very nice and we built a good relationship with a super science high school.
                    The goal of the trip was to establish a relationship to promote exchanging students.</p>
