      <h1>The Life and Times of Nick</h1>
      <h2 class="p1">The Big Move</h2>
        <p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">San Diego, California</a>.
          My Father was in the Navy at the time and we lived close to the naval hospital there.
          When I was 7 I learned we were going to move a place in the middle
          of the country, a city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis">St. Louis</a>, in Missouri.
          Needless to say I was not happy with the move but it happened, and I have called
          the "Gateway to the West" home since.

       <h2 id="p2">Getting Started</h2>

       <p>After moving to St. Louis, I begin grade school at Saint Monica Catholic School,
       which is shown above. I spent most of my formative years at this school, then went to
        a jesuit high school, DeSmet, which is shown below. I decided to stay in St. Louis
        for college as well, attending Saint Louis University.</p>

        <h2 id="p3">Where I'm at Now</h2>
          <p>After graduating college, I did not have a career path laid out for me and spent
          awhile trying to figure out what would make me happy. I bounced around a few things,
          and most recently I've worked at Walgreens&reg as a pharmacy technician. Since then
          I have taken a keen interest in coding and programming and have dedicated a lot of my time
          dedicated to learning these skills.</p>
