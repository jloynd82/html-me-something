        <p class = "text"> I was born in January, 1984 in an United States Air Force Hospital in Weisbaden, Germany.
          At this time my dad worked for the Army Corps of Engineers and was stationed over in Germany for almost two years.
          I have two older sisters, Katie who is 6 years older than me, and Susan who is 4 years older than me.
          My parents, my two older sisters, and I returned to the United States in August 1984.
          Needless to say I don't actually remember having lived in Europe since we left when I was only 7 months old,
          but I've been told that I've actually visited most of the countries in Western Europe.</p>

          <p class = "caption"> The elementary school in Crestwood that I attended </p>
          <p class = "text"> After my family returned from Germany we returned to the house in Crestwood that my parents had lived in before going to Europe.
            Except for when I was in college I have lived in St. Louis ever since.
            Later in 1986 my younger brother Steven was born.  Growing up I started attending school in the Lindbergh School District.

        <p class = "text"> Beginning in the fall of 1998 I started attending Lindbergh High School, the 3rd member of my family to do so.
          Overall, I would say that I enjoyed my time in high school.  One of my favorite activities in high school was being a member
          of the Lindbergh High School Spirit of St. Louis Marching Band.  While a member I played the Baritone: </p>

        <p class = "text"> In the fall of 2002 I started at the University of Missouri.  Looking back on it I would say that
          this was one of, if not the best time of my life.  In the spring of 2006 I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science
          degree in Civil Engineering.  After graduation I moved back to St. Louis where I have lived ever since. </p>

        <p class = "text"> Currently, I am taking classes through an organization called Launch Code.
