				<p>Spades is my big girl. She is almost twice as large as Ace (female are usually larger). We actually got lucky and found out she had a Spades symbol on her head - so named her after that since it matches Ace's name.</p>

				<div class="divider">
					<p>- INFORMATION -</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Basil is actually my fiancee's pet. We have a love/hate relationship. He's not blue - he doesn't collect rings. He just kind of deficates everywhere and eats. Also he likes to run in his wheel in the dark throughout the night.  
					<span>
						Contrary to popular belief they are not cuddly, poop everywhere, and are not very social animals.
