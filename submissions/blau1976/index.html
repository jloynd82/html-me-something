                    <h2>Custom Batman Dunny</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy collecting custom designer toys. This is a custom made Dunny made by an artist named FLUKE. He took a custom painted Dunny made by Okkle and added a custom skulpted cape.</p>

                    <h2>Dragon King G.O.D.</h2>
                    <p>This is artist kaNO's interpretation of the late Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee. It is an 8 inch vinal figure based on various Bruce Lee movies and The Crow movie. The figures are limited in production and were only availible in select
                        Comic Con's. </p>

                    <h2>Bella DeLaMere</h2>
                    <p>Discarded with the sump oil at a very early age Bella was swept down stream until she found herself by the sea.  She is part of the Mechatorians collection of toys made by the artist who goes by the name Doktor A.</p>

        <p>So there you have it!  I collect designer toys that seem interesting to me.  I have a small but humble collection of various toys from all different genres.  These toys are more considered works of art, like a painting, than they are toys.
