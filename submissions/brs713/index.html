                <p  class="intro">Rock climbing is an activity that is  potentially fraught with peril.  As such, it requires a lot of safety gear and the options can be a little overwhelming.  Additionally, different types of climbing require different gear, which only serves to compound the difficulties in choosing PPE (personal protective equipment).<br><br>

                This page will discuss the most commonly used gear needed when leading a climb on an already bolted sport route.  It will then further outline a couple of additional options which, while not strictly necessary, lend so much value to the climbing experience that omitting them would detract from not merely the enjoyment, but also, the chances for success.</p>

                    John Bachar, right, used to do it regularly; in fact, he did so successfully for over 30 years.  However, he was unsuccessful once, and that's all it takes to bring this practice to an end.</p><br><br>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing ropes are specialized pieces of equipment.  They are designed with specific properties that decrease the potential for injury on a climb.  It is highly inadvisable to climb on a rope not specifically designed for the task being undertaken.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock climbing harnesses enable the wearer to secure the rope to his or her body in such a fashion that, should the user fall, they do so in a way that maintains as much control as possible during the descent.  The rope is tied securely through two points on the harness near the person's center of gravity.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;While the basic configuration for a climbing harness is fairly standard, there are a huge number of manufacturers, each with multiple models.  <a href="http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Climbing-Harness-Reviews/Buying-Advice">Here</a> is a great resource to assist with harness selection.</p>

                    <h4>BELAY DEVICE</h4>

                    <img class="left" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zOR3JHY7SJQ/maxresdefault.jpg">

                    <img class="rght" src="http://www.iafstore.com/imgp/big/c15449.jpg" height="250">

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbatim from the first sentence of Wikipedia's "belay device" entry,</p>
                    <article>"A belay device is a mechanical piece of climbing equipment used to control a rope during belaying."</article>
                    <p>Clear as mud?<br><br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The word belay traces its origins back to the 16th century where it was used as a nautical term to outline the act of securing a rope.  Belaying when climbing does exactly that, stops the movement of the rope.  The ability to halt the travel of the rope will undoubtedly be desired on any climb higher than a few feet.  As such, this is a very important piece of safety equipment.  Again, many designs exist but, regardless of the particular belay device being used, it is imperative that your partner be well versed in its correct &amp; safe operation.</p>

                <div class="category">

                    <h4>LOCKING CARABINER</h4>

                    <img class="rght"  src="http://img.tribevine.com/4edbfc0c357262e563f7f38bb08dfb97.JPG.LARGE.png">

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be used to attach the belay device to your partner's harness.  It is often larger than the 'biners (pronounced <em>BEE-nurz</em>) used in other parts of your climb.  While these carabiners are not significantly stronger than others, they are made of much thicker stock.  Many belay devices are used in such a way that the rope travels over the surface of the locking carabiner, often at tension.  The thickness of this particular style of carabiner minimizes the wear on the rope.<br><br>


                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Carabiners used in this fashion have locking mechanisms (duh!) to prevent accidental opening of the 'biner's gate - a situation that could prove deadly.  Again, there are a fairly wide variety of "lockers."  (I use magnetized 'biners!)</p>

                    <h4>QUICKDRAWS</h4>

                    <img class="left"  src="http://gonzasport.es/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/400x400/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/p/spirit-express_15.jpg">

                    <img class="rght"  src="http://cdn.outdoorgearlab.com/photos/11/90/240484_21854_L.jpg">

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickdraws are used to protect the climb at periodic intervals.  This piece of PPE consists of two carabiners connected at a fairly short distance, most often 12 or 17cm.  The connection is achieved through use of a sling - a generic climbing term for a piece of gear most often made of some type of fabric.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;One carabiner is attached to a "bolt" in the rock face and the other is used to pass the rope through.  Without the use of a quickdraw, if the climber were to fall, they would simply plummet back to earth.  Passing the rope through the lower carabiner provides a fulcrum where the rope's travel can be arrested.  Multiple quickdraws are used on a sport route to maintain a possible safe falling distance as the climber ascends.<br><br>


                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Modern quickdraws often come preassembled with specific carabiners used at each end - one to attach to the bolt on the wall and the other intended for contact with the rope.  Moreover, the sling also has a correct (and incorrect) orientation.<br><br>


                    &nbsp;&nbsp;To beat the horse's corpse yet again, options are vast to allow for best use in the different situations that can arise.  Most common are scenarios where a large collection of gear is needed on a climb, making weight a main consideration.  Another prime example is the use of a longer sling in a situation where the bottom carabiner would overhang a piece of rock. If a climber were to fall onto a carabiner half on and half off a rocky ledge, the force of the fall could cause the rock edge to fold the carabiner, weakening it past its breaking point, causing the climber to fall further, which allows the forces generated by the fall to continue to increase.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, correct usage is, again, paramount.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a car's tires are the only contact with the road, your hands &amp; feet are (most often) the only control surfaces utilized to manipulate your body up the rock.  Climbing shoes have your feet covered (quite literally), but how do you maximize your hands' grip on the rock?<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Chalk has been a go-to staple for improving hand friction for decades and I'm certain you won't be surprised to learn that you have quite a number of options in this category as well.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;The choices presented thus far have been innumerable, and this is only scratching the surface of just one small aspect of the activities undertaken when attempting to climb rocks.  At this point, you may be wondering why on earth anyone would want to go through all the headaches of parsing this information and readily subjecting him- or herself to the stresses of all the decision-making involved, only to do something that is unabashedly dangerous and will inevitably lead to frightening and perilous failure.
