                    My 3 year-old son loves Volcanos, for the moment.  This page describes three well known ("well known" is relative) eruptions in his words.

                    <p>
                        I asked my son to describe the Mount Saint Helens eruption:
                    </p>
                    <p class="kid">
                        "I know that it blew a hole, it blew its side off, well it just blew, blew, blew its side.
                         All the trees were knocked down but, some survived, plinian, super strong blast!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was his description of the Mount Saint Helens eruption that occurred at 8:32 AM on May 18, 1980.
                        For those who know nothing about volcanos, like me, until my three year insisted on learning about them,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plinian_eruption">plinian</a> is a type of eruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To learn more about this eruption from an adult from

                <section>
                    <a name="Krakatoa"></a>
                    <h2 class="newVolcano">Krakatoa</h2>

                    <p>
                        Then I asked him to describe Krakatoa:
                    </p>
                    <p class="kid">
                        "So it has some magma and when the magma got to the top it exploded and then it left a half mile
                        hole in the ocean floor deep. I can't guess what kind of eruption on an island in the ocean,
                        what state is it in?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This volcano is in Indonesia on an island named Krakatoa.  I haven't found anyone else talking about a half of mile hole
                        that was created on the ocean floor, but the island did get quite a bit smaller because of the volcano's explosive eruption.

                        It should also be noted that the sound of the eruption might have been the loudest in human history.

                <section>
                    <a name="Tambora"></a>
                    <h2 class="newVolcano">Mount Tambora</h2>

                    <p>
                        Finally I asked him to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79">Mount Vesuvius (Pompeii)</a>
                        , but he told me he wanted to talk about Tambora instead:
                    </p>
                    <p class="kid">
                        "So it was a super colossal and it didn't blow its side it just blew its crater, in Indonesia, Dad, I want to be done working
                        on the website"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, that didn't last as long as I anticipated, usually the boy goes on and on about volcanos, but I guess when your
                        parents ask you to do something it just isn't as fun anymore.  Anyway, the
                        <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/blast-from-the-past-65102374/?all">Mount Tambora Eruption</a>
                        of 1815 was one of the most powerful in recorded history.  It released so much debris into the atmosphere, that it was
                        said 1816 didn't have a summer.  There are some descriptions from New England where the wash on the line to dry was
                        frozen stiff in July!
