                    <h2>O'Fallon Township High School</h2>
                    <h3>Student Computer Technician</h3>
                    <p class="main">I helped maintain the computers by troubleshooting them when
                    problems arose, cleaning them, and installing new software as needed.
                    I also helped install new network lines and cameras, running the cables to the
                    necessary locations.This was the first job that I ever held and
                    started as a summer position that earned me a few bucks while
                    I was still in school. In my senior year I also worked during
                    the school year as part of the co-op program, giving me one
                    of the shortest commutes to work I've ever heard of.</p>

                    <a name="City Hall"></a>
                    <h2>O'Fallon, Illinois City Hall</h2>
                    <h3>IT Intern</h3>
                    <p class="main">I helped decomission old computers for the city, reformatting
                        the hard drives so that they were still imediately useable,
                        but didn't have any city documents or software on them. I also
                        helped to upgrade the computers at the local police station,
                        providing them with new computers and monitors with all the
                        necessary software pre installed. It was an interesting position
                        that I was offered through my job at the school. I worked both
                        positions for a while, but my boss at the city was rarely around
                        and I still had school to deal with as well. In the end, I left
                        the job after about eight months, but stuck with the school as
                        long as I could.</p>

                    <a name="Blockbuster"></a>
                    <h2>Blockbuster</h2>
                    <h3>Customer Service Representative</h3>
                    <p class="main">This one's pretty self explanatory if you've ever been inside
                        a Blockbuster, but my job was to to keep the manage returned
                        movies, keep the shelves stocked as best as possible, and to
                        check out customers. We also had the occasional overnight
                        inventory shift, but that was fortunately just a once a month
                        thing. This job was certainly not the greatest, as most retail
                        workers will say about their position, but it came with some
                        nice perks for someone like me(10 free rentals a week!) and it
                        helped keep me fed through college so I guess it wasn't so
                        bad.</p>

                    <h2>MC Machinery</h2>
                    <h3>Electronics Bench Technician</h3>
                    <p class="main">For this job, I repaired the main control boards for older
                        EDM(Electrical Discharge Machining) cutting machines by cleaning
                        them, troubleshooting what was wrong with their circuits,
                        and replacing any defective components. I would then test
                        the boards in our own machine to verify their working status.
                        Being my first job out of college, I had hoped for a better
                        paying position, as I made nowhere near a living wage for
                        the area. I enjoyed the job immensely, but after a year of
                        working and no hope for a pay raise, I was left with no choice
                        but to leave.</p>

                    <h2>Allied Barton</h2>
                    <h3>Security Center Operator</h3>
                    <p class="main">This job was somewhat of a jump from my previous positions
                        and had me monitoring alarms for John Deere facilities across
                        across the country as a contract security officer. I would
                        dispatch onsite security or emergency services to facilities
                        based on alarm criteria as well as assisst anyone calling into
                        the ops center. I got this job thanks to a friend I met in
                        college who recomended it to me when he heard about my employment
                        troubles. He offered me a room at his place for cheap rent and
                        a good word with the hiring manager which led to a job making
                        quite a bit more money than before and with regular raises.
                        Despite the excellent area and decent pay though, this job
                        too came to an end so I could come take some launchcode classes
                        and get into a career path that I could actually enjoy.</p>
