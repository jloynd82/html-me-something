        <p>In May of 2016, my lady friend (Debbie), and I had an opportunity to take an eight day trip to Puerto Rico.
        Now, she has travelled extensively around the world.  I on the otherhand, have been out of the country only
        once when we went to Jamaica for a few days.</p>

        <p>The first few nights we stayed at <a href="http://www.lemontreepr.com/">Lemontree Oceanfront Cottages</a>.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, a lot of time had to be spent driving form place-to-place in a rental car.  Gasoline was about
         57&cent; to 62&cent; per liter*.  The drivers there are a little crazy.  And, some of the mountain roads are a white
         knuckle affair.</p>
         <article>*Surprisingly, the cost for gas was very close to what it was at home at the time.</article>


        <p>While in PR, we enjoyed local foods, horseback riding, beach time, sightseeing, coffee plantations, and more.
        It's a beautiful place.  The locals were friendly and, aside from the occasional language barrier, very helpful.</p>

         <p class="good">I have to say, every destination was well worth the effort.</p>

         <p>I didn't care much for the air travel.  But, overall, it was a trip well worth taking.</p>
         <p ID="recap"> I would love to do it again.</p>
