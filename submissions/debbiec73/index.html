          <p class = "padding">Hi, my name is Debbie and I want to be a software developer.  I have played around with coding for many years now, but really want to do it for a living.
        I love to solve problems and find web development to be fun and exciting.  I love learning the logic of OOP and bending the code to my will.  Javascript is fun, exciting and so
        dynamically fun!  I enjoy Java as well.  I love front end work but am very interested in the back end as well.  I enjoy setting up a stack on my laptop and then just building
      things</p>

          <h1>Technical Summary</h1>
            <p>I have done front end programming using html, css, and javascript.  I have had lots of fun with bootstrap getting things up and running fast.  I have used PHP and SQL on the back end.  I have taken classes
              devoted to C as well as some devoted to learning programming concepts that used Java.</p>
              <p>I have used frameworks/libraries/toolkits such as AngularJS, NodeJS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Bower, Drupal 7, and a little wordpress</p>
              <p>As far as operating systems I have stuck mostly to Windows, and some linux while running a virtual machine</p>
              <p>I have used git for version control as well as slack and trello for collaboration tools</p>

      <h1>Technical/Education Summary</h1>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in Launch Code and Washington University's Summer of Code.  It is a 20 week long class consisting of three units.  The first unit was learning Java and basic OOP programming.
        The second unit is called web development fundamentals.  We are learning about the basics of web development and creating web apps.  In the third unit we will create our own web app based on all that we
        have learned as a final project</p>
        <p>I have completed the first three courses in Coursera's Full Stack Web Development Specialization.  Each class built on the last culminating in building a single page application using AngularJS in the
          third class, "Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS" <a href="https://github.com/debbiec73/conFusion">Website</a>
